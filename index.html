						<p>
							A simple, yet highly customizable plugin to handle all of you're client-side repetitive DOM needs. Simple, quick and powerful templating. It is modeled after ng-repeat and shares some basic syntax, but is not a clone. I wrote this after using angular for a personal project. I found the framework to be heavy for most of my needs, but loved ng-repeat. So i wrote a plugin to bring this great feature to jQuery, for less! It's backed by mustache.js and showcases JavaScripts awesome prototype inheritance.

							BitR is a Web portal to a Bitmessage, an encrypted, anonymizing, decentralized, and trust-less kind of email communication. It was my cohorts final project and i was the project leader. We chose python with the django framework and a postgres database for the back-end. Conveniently, Bitmessage has a JSON API that we used for access to everything from users messages to generating new user identities. The front is clean and simple, using Google's material inspired UI built on twitter-bootstrap. Once logged in everything is loaded via AJAX and the user has most of the functionality of the native Bitmessage client, jQuery and mustache.js are used to implement these features.

						<h2>Dynamic Proxy</h2>
						<p>
							Must software is written for to make humans life simpler, this is one of them. A friend and I got feed up with out ISP changing our IP's and losing access to our system. We modified the node module dnsd to query questions to a redis instance and a few lines of PHP for API calls to update records. This worked for some time, but more could to be done. I wrote a web-interface in laravel to manually add and update records.

						<h3>My experience</h3>
						<p>
							I learned a lot from my 12 weeks at Byte Academy. My instructors were awesome, very knowledgeable and attentive. It was my first time using python and a great way learn a fun and powerful language. After learning the basics of python, we dove into the django framework. I found django to be a great web framework, but found python to be clumsy compared to PHP/node for web programing.<br />
							I learned about project work-flow, using git and the power of pair-programing. We also did algorithm writing such as bubble-sort and queuing.<br />
							The financial part was big bonus, as i was not looking to for a finTech camp. Learning about bound yields and cash-flows was great and i am very happy to have gained this knowledge. I wish i had more time with this topic, as the field is so wide and deep.
